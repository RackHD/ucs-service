# ucs-service

‘ucs-service’ is a module used by RackHD to interface with hardware being managed by a Cisco UCS manager.
RackHD can retrieve UCS hardware data via http/https APIs of ucs-service, ucs-service will then send request to Cisco UCS manager to collect data and return to RackHD.
Besides synchronous APIs, ucs-service also provides asynchronous API which can solve UCSM slow response problem. Celery is used as task queue for asynchronous API design.

## installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## configuration

Before user starts ucs-service, there are some configurations should be set:

* **address**: network address ucs service will listen.
* **port**: network port ucs service will listen.
* **httpsEnable**: if set to true, https will be used. Other wise http will be used.
* **keyFile**: key file for https.
* **certFile** certification file for https.
* **callbackUrl**: RackHD callback API. ucs-service asynchronous API will post data to RackHD via this callback.
* **concurrency**: Celery concurrent process number, default is 2.
* **session**: After ucs-service login UCSM, it will keep login active for a duration of "session", default it is 60 seconds.

All configurations are stored in config.json, in the root path of ucs-service directory.

## start the service

To start the service:

    python app.py
    python tasks.py worker

If you have supervisord available, you can use ucs-service-ctl.sh to start the service:

    sudo ./ucs-service-ctl.sh start

Script ucs-service-ctl.sh can also be used to stop the service:

    sudo ./ucs-service-ctl.sh stop

## testing
